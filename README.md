# Different-Methods

# What is this?

You can choose your own method and execute via the pipe.

# How to use?

Code a NamedPipe Exec System, and Type the Code.

# How is it useful?

You can use tons of exec methods in 1 api.

Don't make tons of apis for just "1" dll method :/

# How to use 2?

Where it says "Execute via" is the code for execution.

Remember that all different execution methods  need different pipes.
